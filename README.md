### ‚ú® Special Features: "B√≥riya" from *Comrades Studio* ü§ùüèª

* Our map is dynamic! The map overall is 25 x 25, but the player will start with a smaller map. As they level up, the
horizons they can explore will grow.

* ASCII art implementation for the map, in order to increase immersion for the player.
  
* Colour coded print statements that increase readability of the game. 

* We have added additional combat statistics to the game:
    * **Armor Class** stat that dictates how likely a character is able to block/dodge an attack from a foe.
    * **Initiative modifier** that will add bonuses to the initiative roll of a character.
    * **Attack modifier** that increases the chance a character will land a hit on a foe.
    * **Damage modifier** that acts as a source of consistent damage, in case a character/foe rolls poorly.
    * **Critical Hit** mechanic:
      * The critical hit mechanic works by checking a character's attack roll and comparing it to their critical 
        hit chance. Some classes such as the Rogue have higher chances to critical hit.
      * Once a critical hit has been established, a characters critical hit modifier is used to calculate the 
    total damage they inflicted.
    
* Healing takes into account a class' hit die rather than a constant value. This was implemented to increase variety 
in classes, as well as to help with game balance.
  
* EXP gain has also been altered to allow characters to gain at least some EXP if the foe's flee. This was 
implemented to be more in line with mainstream RPG games, as well as to speed up the game.
  
* Improved input validation not only verifies if you have input a valid direction to travel, but also it
  checks if you may have inputted something other than a valid menu choice 
  (i.e. if you didn't enter a valid number choice by accident, we got you!).
  
* We have a complex set of foes in the level of weak, strong, and epic. Each foe has unique statistics and only certain
foes may appear during a player's level.
  

### üìù Special Notes

* Although it may seem that the map is not 25x25 at first, this was a conscious decision in order give the player's
a reward for levelling up. Similar to how RPGs have areas on a map that you are not able to enter until you have 
  reached a certain level.
  
* If you'd like to beat the game the fastest way possible, we suggest following the class guidelines. The Illusionist
 for example has a very weak early game, so any time you take damage it is probably a good idea to flee and restore 
  your health in order to prepare for the next battle. Likewise, in the endgame, the Ranger class is weaker than the 
  other classes, so it is important to take note of your health as you travel through the map.
  
* In addition, HP is only gained when moving through the map. If you were to gain a level, your MAX HP increases, 
however that still means you will have to move around to heal your current health to your MAX HP levels.
  
* The final boss is located at 24, 24: so if you would like to finish the game as fast as possible, we suggest moving 
in a south-easterly direction.
  
* The game has been balanced to be relatively easy to win with all classes, but if you find yourself struggling, we 
recommend opting for the Paladin class as it seems to perform the most consistently.
